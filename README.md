# Login-Popup-Form 🚀
This is a simple login popup form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a login button that opens up a popup form when clicked. The form has fields for username, email, and a checkbox to receive updates from the blog. It also has two buttons, one for submitting the form and the other for logging in with a Google account.

# Credits ©️
The design and code for this login popup form were created by me. If you find this code useful, feel free to use it in your own projects.
